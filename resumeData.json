I use my love for science and passion for software engineering to code a resolution to every inconvenience I come across. Currently, I am researching ways that I can extend my skills into a Software Engineering role in a tech or business field. Outside of my projects and school, I love to play volleyball or Pokemon Unite with my friends. I'm also an avid fan of Aviation and NCAA Wrestling. I'm always open to having a discussion about the most recent tournament or the latest trend in the airline industry. Feel free to send me an email and start the conversation!",
